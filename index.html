           <h2>A data driven analysis of strategic grenade usage in Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
          <p>By <a href = 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyran-adams/'>Kyran Adams</a></p>
           <p>Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) is a team-based strategic shooter that has not stopped growing in popularity since its release, seven years ago. A game is between two teams of five players and many rounds. In each round, one team, the Terrorists (T), attempts to plant a bomb and defend it until it detonates while the other team, the Counter Terrorists (CT), attempts to stop the bomb plant or defuse it once it's planted. Either team can also win the round by killing all players on the enemy team.</p>
           <p>One thing that has always drawn me to this game is the strategic importance of utility — smoke grenades (smokes), flashbangs (flashes), high explosives (HEs), and molotov cocktails. A well-thrown smoke can give your team cover to advance into a new position or block eyesight from an enemy and can have a pivotal role on the round. I am interested in deriving the strategic effectiveness of different uses of utility from data. This information would allow players to figure out what utility is effective or even uncover utility that is commonly thought to be effective, but isn’t.</p>
