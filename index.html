      <h2>A data driven analysis of strategic grenade usage in Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
      <p>By <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyran-adams/'>Kyran Adams</a></p>

      <p>Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) is a team-based strategic shooter in the Counter Strike series, which
        has nearly 20 years of competitive history and tournaments now often offering prize pools of more than
        $1,000,000. </p>
      <p>One thing that has always drawn me to this game is the strategic importance of utility â€” smoke grenades
        (smokes), flashbangs (flashes), and high explosives (HEs). A well-thrown smoke can give your team cover to
        advance into a new position or block eyesight from an enemy, helping your team win the round.</p>
      <p><b><i>Keep scrolling.</i></b> Using data from <a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/skihikingkevin/csgo-matchmaking-damage">this
        kaggle dataset,</a> we will analyze thousands of rounds of CS: GO to determine the best positions to use
        utility.
        Pictured on the right is an aggregation of all of the smokes thrown by Counter Terrorists across thousands of
        games.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="step" id="section2">
      <h1>CS: GO</h1>
      <p>First, I will give a small explanation of how the game works.</p>
      <p>A round is between two teams of five players. In each round, one team, the Terrorists (T), tries to plant the
        bomb on one of the bombsites and defend it until it detonates. The other team, the Counter Terrorists (CT),
        attempts to stop the bomb plant or defuse it once it's planted.</p>
      <p><i>On the right</i>, we have grenades through by Ts (red) and grenades thrown by CTs (blue) in
        a single round. The CTs won this round.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <p>Now, to do some more in depth analysis, we're going to combine all of the utility used from each team by type.
        <i>Here on the right</i> are smokes thrown by CTs in every round. </p>
      <p>In order to get some idea of how location of utility relates with effectiveness, we could color
        grenades based on the result of the round, which we we will do next.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h1>Effectiveness of Smokes</h1>
      <p>Here, all of the smoke grenades are colored red if that round was won by the
        thrower and blue if it was lost. However, the patterns are a little unclear and it's hard to figure out which locations
        are the best locations to throw grenades.
      </p>
      <p>In fact, we're not just interested in the the impact of individual points, we're more interested
        in grouping smokes together and determining the average impact for that group. To do that, we can use a clustering algorithm.</p>
      <p></p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h1>Clusters</h1>
      <p>One clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, creates clusters that correspond to high density areas of points and leave lower density areas outliers.
        We can use this to color the smokes on the right based on their cluster.</p>
      <p>We can then run logistic regression using these cluster counts as predictors. We are basically asking the
        question: <i>What is the average change in the likelihood of winning from throwing one additional grenade in any
          particular cluster?</i></p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h2>Effectiveness of Counter Terrorist Smoke Clusters</h2>
      <p>Here are the results, where the average effect of a cluster is plotted as the color of that cluster. The more
        blue a cluster is, the more it helps CTs. The more red, the more it helps Ts. The color of the outliers (a non-clustered smoke)
        is based on the average effect of all of the outliers, which has a large variance.</p>
      <p>From this graph we can see that the most effective smokes are mid-connector, t ramp (especially deep ramp), and palace. In fact, in relation to the other types of nades, CT smokes are very effective.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h2>Effectiveness of Terrorist Smoke Clusters</h2>
      <p>Terrorist smokes are more variable in their effectiveness. Some are extremely effective, and some actually help
        the CTs (this could be because they warn the CTs of an incoming push). The most effective smokes
        are top mid, stairs, front halls, A site, kitchen window, and jungle. The most ineffective smokes are
        jungle/connector, jungle, lower mid, palace, top mid. Sandwich is the only statistically
        significantly bad for the Ts, which makes sense, as it is not an intentional smoke, and usually signifies
        a missed stairs smoke.</p>
      <p>One interesting result is that some clusters are very close together, but have very
        different effects. One example is that a deeper top mid smoke onto catwalk is much more effective than a shallow one.
        Similarly, missing the jungle smoke by even a bit reduces the effectiveness considerably.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h2>Effectiveness of Counter Terrorist Flash Clusters</h2>
      <p>It seems that for CTs, flashing to take underpass is very strong. This makes sense as
        it is very difficult to defend against this flash, and strategically, CT taking underpass control cuts off half
        the map for Ts. It also seems cluster  connector, T ramp, and outside T
        ramp are very good. Mid window flash is not very good. It is interesting that CT flashes seem more effective than
        terrorist flashes in winning the round, and more statistically significant.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h2>Effectiveness of Terrorist Flash Clusters</h2>
      <p>For terrorists, the strongest flashes were outside apartments and underpass. It is
        interesting that top mid over ramp are not very effective at all, despite being very common. It is very interesting that
        outside b apartments, one of the most common flashes for attacking B, is actually negatively impactful. This could be
        because it alerts the enemy of the attack rather than surprises them.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h2>Effectiveness of Counter Terrorist HE Clusters</h2>
      <p>It seems that CT HE's are very effective, especially in top of mid, palace, and underpass.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h2>Effectiveness of Terrorist HE Clusters</h2>
      <p>Many terrorist HE's also are very effective. Mid window, connector and jungle are incredibly
        effective. HE's are also interesting in that they are
        quite effective also when not in any cluster at all (the -1 cluster).</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h2>Effectiveness of Terrorist Groups of Smokes</h2>
      <p>I performed logistic regression on just terrorist smokes, but added interaction terms between groups of smokes
        that I thought might be significant, such as CT + stairs + connector/jungle for taking A.</p>
      <p>I found that out of these groups, none had a significant increase in chance of terrorist wins, and most
        actually decreased the chances that terrorists would win. My hypothesis is that often at lower ranked play,
        players throw smoke groups simply because they see professional players doing it, and not actually for a
        strategic advantage. However, when players throw individual smokes, they do it more strategically. .</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h1>Effectiveness of Utility as a Whole</h1>
      <p>Finally, I aggregated all of the data together and ran logistic regression to find the average effect of
        utility by its team and type.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, terrorist flashes are the weakest out of all types of utility, with almost a negligible effect
        on round wins! HEs are also surprisingly strong.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <h1>Takeaways: How should I use my utility?</h1>
      <p>Through this analysis we found many interesting results impacting strategy (at least at the
        nonprofessional levels from which this data was collected). Here are some takeaways to guide utility usage
        on de_mirage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> As a T, one should be careful using flashes without thought. The most commonly thrown flashes are
          actually very ineffective - top mid, T ramp, and over B apartments. In fact, common flashes (those in clusters) are not much better on average
          than the rest.
        </li>
        <li>As a counter terrorist, almost all common flashes are good.</li>
        <li>HEs are much more effective than I previously believed, for both teams. CT HEs are effective in clusters and
          outside of clusters. T HEs are effective in <i>some</i> clusters and out of clusters. Some T clusters are
          ineffective and should be avoided.
        </li>
        <li>Smokes are, as expected, the most effective type of utility. They have a strongest net effect from Ts, even
          though CT smokes have a more consistent effect across the different clusters.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The biggest takeaway from this is to be intentional with utility. Many of the ineffective uses of utility that
        I found align with common patterns at lower levels, which I hypothesize are simply done out of habit rather than
        strategy.</p>
